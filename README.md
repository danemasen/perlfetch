# Perlfetch - A Tiny System Information Script
Perlfetch is my first project, and was made so I could learn Perl.

The script is currently at <50 lines of code, and is <2700 bytes.

This project is still work in progress! Further testing/development is required before it's complete.

Perlfetch has only been tested on \[Void\] Linux and OS X!
